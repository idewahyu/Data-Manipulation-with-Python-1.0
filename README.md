## Data Manipulation
Data Manipulation aims to facilitate data analysis by machines.

## Pandas
Pandas is an open-source library that is made mainly for working with relational or labeled data both easily and intuitively.

## NumPy
NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.

## Object Series
Series is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding data of any type (integer, string, float, python objects, etc.).

## Loc
loc() is label based data selecting method which means that we have to pass the name of the row or column which we want to select. This method includes the last element of the range passed in it, unlike iloc(). loc() can accept the boolean data unlike iloc() .

## Iloc
iloc() is a indexed based selecting method which means that we have to pass integer index in the method to select specific row/column. This method does not include the last element of the range passed in it unlike loc(). iloc() does not accept the boolean data unlike loc().
